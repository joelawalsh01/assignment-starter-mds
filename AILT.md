## Course Context: COMP 395 – AI and Learning Technologies

**Course Overview:** This upper-division computer science course bridges educational theory and artificial intelligence. Students explore learning theories (behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, constructionism) and their implications for designing computer-assisted learning technologies—from early teaching machines to modern Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Generative AI.

**Student Profile:** Primarily computer science majors, with some students from other disciplines (education, cognitive science, etc.). Students have working knowledge of Python and version control (GitHub). Multidisciplinary teams collaborate throughout the course.

**Pedagogical Approach:** A significant component of the course teaches systems design, infrastructure, and how web applications work through "vibecoding"—rapid, AI-assisted prototyping where students learn by building. Students use tools like Figma, Streamlit, and Claude Code to quickly iterate on ideas while developing practical understanding of REST APIs, frontend technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), and deployment pipelines (CI/CD).

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze educational tools through major learning theories
- Critique the history of teaching machines and recurring ed-tech pitfalls
- Design, prototype, and evaluate AI-driven learning technologies
- Evaluate ethical implications (data privacy, algorithmic bias)
- Develop practical skills in web app architecture and rapid prototyping

**Assignment Types:**
- *Labs/Studios (20%):* Hands-on exercises applying concepts—both theoretical (designing reinforcement schedules) and technical (building prototypes, working with APIs)
- *Individual Assignments (15%):* Theoretical analysis of existing tools or reading reflections
- *Projects (47%):* Team-based design, prototyping, and evaluation of novel learning technologies

**Submission & Tools:** Coding assignments are submitted via GitHub Classroom. Students are expected to use proper commit practices and may have CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.

**AI Policy:** Students may use AI tools but must disclose use, include a "prompts appendix," and explain the reasoning behind AI-generated decisions.


**Note for Beamers and Latex:** When generating slides as Beamers, please make it so that code lines aren't in the slides involving code, as this makes it difficult for students to copy and paste the code. You need to add the upquote package to keep the quotes as straight ASCII quotes that copy correctly as well

**Note on Pedagogy**
Some activities need to be didactic, but generally the approach should be from a cognitivist ( metacognition, attention to forming schema) or constructivist ( students build knowledge together). In instructional slides there should be small activities where students think pari share about bigger ideas, or to discuss conceptual knowldge
