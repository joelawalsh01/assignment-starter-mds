## Course Context: COMP 395 – Deep Learning

**Course Overview:** This upper-division computer science course covers the theoretical foundations and practical applications of deep neural networks. Students learn the mathematics of backpropagation, optimization strategies, and modern architectures including CNNs (vision), RNNs/LSTMs (sequences), and Transformers (NLP and vision). The course emphasizes both rigorous mathematical understanding and hands-on implementation.

**Student Profile:** Primarily computer science majors with working knowledge of Python and calculus. Students are expected to be comfortable with partial derivatives, matrix operations, and debugging code. Some students may come from adjacent quantitative fields.

**Pedagogical Approach:** This course prioritizes deep understanding over rapid prototyping. Students must grasp the underlying mathematics (chain rule, gradients, loss landscapes) and be able to implement core algorithms from scratch before using high-level abstractions. AI tools may be used for boilerplate code (environment setup, data loading, plotting), but students must be able to explain and recreate the logic of any neural network code they submit.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the mathematical basis of learning in neural networks
- Implement deep learning models using PyTorch (and sometimes raw NumPy)
- Diagnose and resolve common training issues (overfitting, vanishing gradients)
- Read and implement concepts from current research papers
- Consider ethical implications of large-scale AI deployment

**Assignment Types:**
- *Labs (24%):* Paired, guided exercises applying new concepts (e.g., building a perceptron, setting up training loops). Due end of day.
- *Homework (30%):* Individual implementation tasks requiring deeper engagement—often "from scratch" implementations alongside PyTorch versions
- *Projects (21%):* Larger builds (image classifiers, sentiment analysis tools). Individual or group work, individual submission.
- *Quizzes (12%):* Timed, individual programming assignments. Open book/internet, no communication.

**Submission & Tools:** Coding assignments are submitted via GitHub Classroom. Students use Python 3 and PyTorch. Proper commit practices expected.

**AI Policy:** AI/LLM use is permitted for boilerplate and debugging, but students must include a transcript of any AI conversation in their submission. Students must be able to verbally explain any code they submit—inability to do so is considered plagiarism.

**Note for Beamers and Latex:** When generating slides as Beamers, please make it so that code lines aren't in the slides involving code, as this makes it difficult for students to copy and paste the code. You need to add the upquote package to keep the quotes as straight ASCII quotes that copy correctly as well
